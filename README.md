# POMDP
Intelligent Attention Management using Integrated Planning and Perception

An individual research project dealing with suggesting optimal policy for multitasking users. The systems consists of two parts; a perception algorithm and a decision system. This repository basically deals with the perception algorithm and doesn't have the POMDP solver. 

The perception algorithm fundamentally works on top of the data fetched from the camera and preprocessing it with the Dlib library. Then the essential features from the face is extracted.
